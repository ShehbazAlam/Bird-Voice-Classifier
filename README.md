# Bird Voice Classifier

## Overview

The Bird Voice Classifier is a machine learning project that aims to classify bird species based on their vocalizations. The project uses audio recordings of bird calls and songs to train a model that can identify different bird species.

## Project Description

The Bird Voice Classifier leverages audio processing and machine learning techniques to recognize bird species from audio recordings. The project includes the following components:

- Data preprocessing: Converting raw audio files into features suitable for machine learning.
- Model training: Training a neural network model using the extracted features.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on a test dataset.
- Inference: Using the trained model to classify new audio recordings.

## Installation

To set up the Bird Voice Classifier project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-voice-classifier.git
cd bird-voice-classifier
```
2. **Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Download the dataset:**

Download the bird audio dataset and place it in the data directory. Ensure the dataset is organized appropriately for training and testing.

##Usage
To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py
To evaluate the model, use the following command:
```
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
To classify a new audio file, use the following command:

```bash
python classify.py --file path/to/audio/file.wav
```
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of audio recordings of bird calls and songs. Each recording is labeled with the corresponding bird species. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model
The Bird Voice Classifier uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the audio features and classify the bird species. The model architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Below is a summary of the model's performance:

- Training Accuracy: X%
- Validation Accuracy: X%
- Test Accuracy: X%
